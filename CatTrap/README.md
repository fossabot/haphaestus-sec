# CatTrap
[Repository](https://git.argonaut-constellation.org/~alcinnz/CatTrap) | [Issue Tracker](https://todo.argonaut-constellation.org/)

Lays out boxes according to the [CSS Box Model](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-box-3/), computing where to place e.g. images, paragraphs, containers, tables, etc onscreen given desired amounts of whitespace.

It is a layout engine for [The Argonaut Stack](https://argonaut-constellation.org/) browser engine, and as such this being the internet some of these boxes will inevitably contain cats.

TODO: Say more about how to use this once its implemented.
