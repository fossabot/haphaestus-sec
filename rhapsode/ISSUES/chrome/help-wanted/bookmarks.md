# Bookmarks
Allow organizing links by tags.

SKOS would be vital here to facilitate more leniency in how these tags are referred to.

---

The experience would be you say "bookmark" or "favourite" in order to pull up a
form to edit the organization of the current page. This would allow your to edit
it's tags or label, or to remove the bookmark entirely.

Then you'd be able to state any of those tags in order to hear everything filed
under it, or if you're already hearing your bookmarks filter your existing search
by that tag.

Petnames can be incorporated into this experience.

NOTE: I'm planning similar for Odysseus, but it's even more natural here.
