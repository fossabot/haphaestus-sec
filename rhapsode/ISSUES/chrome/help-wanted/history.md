# History
**NOTE:** Rhapsode does include history support today, but it's got poor UX.
Still this existing support is useful as a datasource for a better UX!

This page should have a prepopulated "petname".

A single page should be rendered for each day, be punctuated by the hour mark,
and include navigation links to other years, months, and days.
