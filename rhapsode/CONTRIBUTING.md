# Contributing
You can submit contributed code or register "issues" to Haskell Stylist by contacting
me (Adrian Cochrane) via [mastodon](https://floss.social) or [email](mailto:opensource@openwork.nz).
Or you can sign up for an account on the NZ OSS GitLab.

Any issues you report will be described in a markdown file within the ISSUES folder.

To contribute code, you may either send me:

* A link to your online fork from which you want me to `git pull`.
* git patch files, as documented at https://git-send-email.io/

## Potential tasks
* Create a UI for filling in webforms.
* Implement HTTP(S) caching.
* Add support for new network protocols.
* Anything listed under the `ISSUES` folder, especially if it's `help-wanted` subdirectories.

Feel free to ask me if you have any questions.
